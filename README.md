# Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Ian Roller, a technical writer and game developer with a degree in Computer Engineering.

The purpose of this portfolio is to give you, the reader, an idea what I am capable of when it comes to technical writing.

## Portfolio Contents

### Game guide
The game guide is created for a game I created and is meant to feel like old school video game manuals that are both visually intersting and engagaing to read. The intended audience is someone who is new to the game and wants to learn to play and the story before playing.

The game guide can be read here: [Game guide](GAME_GUIDE.md)

### Release Notes


### Style Guide


### Installation guide
The installation guide is a step-by-step guide to installing Git for Windows 11. It is intended for readers with at least a base understanding of computers but may be new to installing software that does not have an application they can physically launch.
